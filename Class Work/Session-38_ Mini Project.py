"""Mini-Project

Shubham had created a program to check his BMI report daily. Shubham is unaware of the Tkinter module in python and doesn't know how to develop a GUI program. To help Shubham and to make a good user experience in the program, create a GUI application.
Use the scale to take inputs.
Give the options to take the input in different units for height and weight.
Show BMI report on a scale. ( use .set() method )
Print underweight, normal, overweight on the result with appropriate colors. ( Use red color for overweight and underweight and green for healthy range )
Save height, weight, BMI, and date in a text file.
