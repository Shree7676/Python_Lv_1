Sahil creates a list of fruits and prints the values.
Most of the time while creating the list, He enters some value multiple times.
He doesnâ€™t want to repeat the value. Write a python program and use a set instead of a list.
Take the input from the users until users select to discontinue.
And print all the unique values at the end.
Hint: Use a while loop to repeat the main program and use the set to store the value.
