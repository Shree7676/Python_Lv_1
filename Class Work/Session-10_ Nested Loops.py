In-class exercise

●	A bricklayer was putting the tiles on the floor. He wanted to calculate the number of tiles that are required to fill the entire floor with the tiles. The dimensions of the floor were 12 tiles x 9 tiles. Write a program in python to calculate the total number of tiles required to fill the floor using nested loops. Can we use while loops at the place of for loops? Try it.
●	.
●	.
●	Answer :  108
●	Code:
➔	count = 0
➔	for i in range(12):
➔	    for j in range(9):
➔	        count += 1
➔	print(count)
➔	.
➔	.

●	At the same place where the bricklayer was working. So many red bricks were kept cubical. The dimensions of the structure were 6 bricks x 6 bricks x 6 bricks. Chris wanted to count the number of bricks, but he was not able to do that as all the bricks were not visible to him. To help Chris, write a program in python to count the number of bricks available there using nested for loop. What is another way to find the answer? Discuss.
●
●	Answer: 216
●	Code:
➔	count = 0
➔	for i in range(6):
➔	    for j in range(6):
➔	        for k in range(6):
➔	            count += 1
➔	print(count)

●	Moksha wants to know whether 231987 is a prime number or not. He is interested to know whether he can create a program to check if any number is prime or not. He is not aware of the loops and hence is not able to do it. To help Moksha write a program in python to check whether a given number is prime or not.
●	Note: Write the entire program inside a loop so that the user can use the program multiple times without running it again and again.

●	Arvind came to know about the Fibonacci series.
●	Note:
●	The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two that precede it. Starting at 0 and 1, the sequence looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on forever. The Fibonacci sequence can be described using a mathematical equation: Xn+2= Xn+1 + Xn.
●	Arvind is very interested to know the 100th term of the Fibonacci series. He was adding the values manually in a calculator but it was taking so much time for him to find any term of the Fibonacci series. To help Arvind write a program that can print nth term of the Fibonacci series where n is the given term by the user. Also, write the entire program inside a loop so that the user can use the program multiple times without running the program again and again.
