"""Homework questions
Nidhi is creating a program in python for her school project. In between the program, she is converting numerical numbers into word format again and again. Then she realizes that she needs a function that can convert a number into word format with hyphens between each word. ( for example 57 = five-seven ). To help Nidhi create a function toWord() that can do the same thing.
Hint: Use for loop and use if-elif-else condition
Sample run:
>> toWord(89)
>> eight-nine
>> toWord(398)
>> three-nine-eight
