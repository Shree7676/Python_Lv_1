●	Arjun is the monitor of his class and his teacher told him to collect the email id of all the students. He created the list of email ids in a text file and now before he sends the list to his teacher, he wants to check whether all the email id in the list is valid or not. It will take a lot of time to verify it manually. To help him, create a program in python where he can enter the email id and the program will print valid if the email id is valid and not valid if the email id is not valid.
●	Hint: Using membership operator check whether email id contains @ and .com
●	Also, make sure .com occurs at the end
●	Sample run example:
●	>> hello@gmail.com → valid
●	>> example@outlook.com → valid
●	>> .com@first → invalid
●	>> paypal → invalid
●	.

●	Kishan wanted to know which day it will be on 2nd November 2022. He didn’t have the calendar at that time so he was not able to predict the date. Later he came to know that it was Wednesday on 02/11/2022. However, he got curious and thought is there any way or formula to find the day on a particular date instantly. After searching this thing on google he got Zeller’s rule that can actually help us in ****************(pending)
