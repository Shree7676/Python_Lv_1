A school has the following rules for the grading system.
a. Below 25 - F
b. 25 to 45 - E
c. 45 to 50 - D
d. 50 to 60 - C
e. 60 to 80 - B
f. Above 80 â€“ A

By mistake, the grades ( A, B, C, D, E ) were not printed in some of the student's mark sheets.
They want to know their grades, but they are confused with the grading system.
Himanshi decided to create a python program where students can enter their marks and
it will show their grades on the screen. However, she got stuck in between with her program.
So write a program in python to solve the same issue and help Himanshi. What did you learn from Himanshi? Discuss.
Ask the user to enter marks and print the corresponding grade.
