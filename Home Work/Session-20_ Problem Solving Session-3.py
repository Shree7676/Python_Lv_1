Homework questions
Priyanka just learned functions in python and now she thinks that some problems
can be solved with the help of functions. Like factorials of a number and Fibonacci series.
Write a program in python and create functions for these problems.
Note: Donâ€™t use loops inside functions.
Hint: Call the same function again to do repetitive things.
