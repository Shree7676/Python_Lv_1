"""Homework questions
Nidhi is trying to solve a few questions in mathematics. She is actually finding out the central tendency( mean, median, and mode ) of some numbers. It is taking a lot of time for her to complete the questions. Help Nidhi in solving the following questions. Write the program for each of them.

She wants to find the mean of numbers. Write a program to find the mean of numbers.
Hint: find the sum of all the numbers in the list then divide it with the number of elements present in the list.

Shen wants to find the median as well. Write a program to find the median of numbers in the given list.
Hint: Sort the entire list the print the middle value of the list. If the list contains n numbers where n is even, then find the mean of the middle values.
